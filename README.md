# WordPress Theme Deployment

This repository contains the WordPress theme for [TheBestBlogEver.co](https://thebestblogever.co) and uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment to a web host via FTP.

## Setup Instructions

### Repository Structure

```
.your-repo/
  .github/
    workflows/
      php.yml
  wp-content/
    themes/
      my-theme/
        css/
          style.css
        js/
          main.js
        images/
        template-parts/
        header.php
        footer.php
        sidebar.php
        functions.php
        (other theme files)
  .gitignore
  README.md
  wp-config.php (this file should be ignored in .gitignore)
```

### Deployment Workflow

The deployment workflow is triggered on every push to the `main` branch. It checks out the code, sets up PHP, and deploys the theme files to the specified FTP server.

### Configuration

The workflow file `.github/workflows/php.yml` includes the FTP credentials directly for demonstration purposes. For better security, use GitHub Secrets.

#### `.github/workflows/php.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy WordPress Theme

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: '7.4'

    - name: Sync files via FTP
      uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.1.0
      with:
        ftp-server: 'ftp://your-ftp-server.com'
        ftp-username: 'your-ftp-username'
        ftp-password: 'your-ftp-password'
        local-dir: './wp-content/themes/my-theme'
        remote-dir: '/path-to-your-wordpress/wp-content/themes/my-theme'

    - name: Finalize deployment
      run: echo "Deployment complete!"
```

### Steps to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Modify FTP Credentials:**
   - Update the `ftp-server`, `ftp-username`, and `ftp-password` in the `.github/workflows/php.yml` file.

3. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment:**
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Monitor the workflow to ensure it runs successfully and deploys your theme to the web host.

### Note

For production environments, it is highly recommended to use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information like FTP credentials.

### Best Practices

1. **Use Standard WordPress Structure**:
   - Keep the default WordPress directory structure (`wp-admin`, `wp-content`, `wp-includes`).
   - Place themes in the `wp-content/themes` directory.
   - Place plugins in the `wp-content/plugins` directory.

2. **Separate Custom Code**:
   - Create a custom theme or child theme for your customizations.
   - Use a custom plugin for site-specific functionality instead of adding code to the theme's `functions.php`.

3. **Organize Theme Files**:
   - Use a logical structure for your theme files (e.g., `header.php`, `footer.php`, `sidebar.php`).
   - Create subdirectories for assets like CSS (`/css`), JavaScript (`/js`), and images (`/images`).

4. **Use Template Parts**:
   - Break down large template files into smaller parts using `get_template_part()`. For example, create a `template-parts` directory for reusable components.

5. **Follow Naming Conventions**:
   - Use clear and consistent naming conventions for files and directories.
   - Prefix custom functions and classes to avoid conflicts.

6. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git for version control. Keep your repository clean by adding `wp-config.php` and other sensitive files to `.gitignore`.

7. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Use environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `wp-config-local.php`, `wp-config-staging.php`) and include them conditionally in `wp-config.php`.

8. **Documentation**:
   - Document your code and file structure. Include a `README.md` file at the root of your project with an overview and setup instructions.

9. **Security**:
   - Keep sensitive information out of the repository.
   - Regularly update WordPress core, themes, and plugins.

10. **Backup**:
    - Regularly back up your project files and database.

### Final Steps:

1. **Ensure the Directory Structure:**
   - Make sure your repository follows the provided structure.
   
2. **Create/Update Files:**
   - Place the `.gitignore` and `README.md` files at the root of your repository.
   - Ensure the `php.yml` file is located at `.github/workflows/`.

3. **Commit and Push:**
   - Commit these changes to your repository and push them to GitHub:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add .gitignore and update README.md"
     git push origin main
     ```

By following these steps, your WordPress project will be organized according to best practices and ready for automated deployment using GitHub Actions. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
